# FTCSV2.0
ETSU Faculty Teaching Credentials System (FTCS)

This was a revamp of ETSU's Faculty Teaching Credentials System with newer technology for easier maintainability.  This site also includes the added functionality of allowing the admin to upload Excel files to the database through the website rather than on the backend as was done previously.  The site has fictitious data since the database was not accessible.  Users can view teacher credentials for all instructors, including GAs and lecturers.  Details for the teachers include courses taught, and courses qualified to teach.  Other roles such as admin, credentials officer, and dean, have additional functionality such as assigning courses to teachers.  This is done by logging in for added functionality.
